"""
`WaveSim` contains tools to simulate the damped wave equation ``ü=∇²u-cu̇``.

For an overview of the associated implementations, justification of the equation, and
discretization methods, see https://byuhpc.github.io/sci-comp-course/project/overview.html.

The [`WaveOrthotope`](@ref) type is used to store a wave orthotope's simulation time,
damping coefficient, displacement, and displacement velocity. The simulation can be moved
forward in time with [`step!`](@ref) and [`solve`](@ref), and its energy determined with
[`energy`](@ref). See [`WaveOrthotope`](@ref) for a full list of associated functions.

You can choose between N-dimensional and 2-dimensional implementations of `WaveSim` with
`set_implementation`.

    set_implementation(implementation)

Choose "ND" or "2D" versions of `Mountains`; "ND" is the default.

These are the files in `src` that differ by preference:

| "ND"        | "2D"           |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| `energy.jl` | `energy_2d.jl` |
| `step.jl`   | `step_2d.jl`   |

# Examples

Set implementation to "2D" from the shell:

```bash
julia -e 'using WaveSim; WaveSim.set_implementation("2D")'
```
